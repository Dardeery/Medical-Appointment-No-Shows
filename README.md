# Introduction
This is an attempt to investigate No-Show Appointments dataset of 110,527,000 patient appointments in Brazil . 
The dataset is posted on Kaggle with the following link https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments . 
Here I'm trying to provide some insights reagrding factors that may predict the presence or absence of patient at appointment date based on the hotorical data in the dataset.


To investigate the dataset, A list questions is to be answered:


Which gender did show up more at appointment dates?
What is the most Age category attended the appointment?
Does type of disease affect attendance percentage?
Does the time gap between scheduling and attending the appointment affect the no-show?
