110.527 medical appointments its 14 associated variables (characteristics). The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show to the appointment

# Introduction
This is an attempt to investigate No-Show Appointments dataset of 110,527,000 patient appointments in Brazil. 

The dataset is posted on Kaggle with the following link https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments. 
Here I'm trying to provide some insights reagrding factors that may predict the presence or absence of patient at appointment date based on the hotorical data in the dataset.


To investigate the dataset, A list questions is to be answered:


Which gender did show up more at appointment dates?
What is the most Age category attended the appointment?
Does type of disease affect attendance percentage?
Does the time gap between scheduling and attending the appointment affect the no-show?


## Final remarks and Conclusion 


1. SMS Messaging: 
the results shows the SMS delivery is having a significant impact on the no-show. as the group who received a SMS-reminder did not show up more often compared to those who did not receive a reminder. The group not having received a reminder has a much smaller proportion of No-shows.
 
2. Demographics: 
'Age': the average age of customers who don't show for their appoitnements is a bit higher than the one who shows.
'gender': we can conclude that number of females that come to the clinic is higher than males

3. Diseases: 
all diseases have a very similar Show and No-show proportions,  <b>the type of the disease does not appear to have a relationship with the no-show proportions </b>.

4. General Coorelation: 
the corrleation map shows there is no strong correlation between Show up and any other feature. 


From the above feature importance, we could see that gender in terms of Gender and Age, disease and disability are some of the top features that would help us determine if the patient who has taken an appointment will Show/NoShow.
